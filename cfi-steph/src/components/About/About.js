        Fun fact, I was a flight attendant that became a pilot. I went from
        serving drinks on a plane, to manipulating the aircraft controls. I had
        no aviation knowledge, other than the basics I knew from being a flight
        attendant. One day I decided to finally take the leap and jump head
        first. I quit my job and started flight training right away. I learned
        very quickly that it was going to be a steep learning curve. I was able
        to do a very fast paced program and spent 10 months of my life doing
        nothing but eat, sleep, fly, and study aviation. I’m now fleet technical
        instructor teaching 737 systems knowledge. This website came about
        because I struggled to understand a majority of the information and
        let’s face it, not a lot of ground was given. I had to find other
        sources to get information broken down. Once becoming a CFI, I decided I
        wanted to create a website that help take all the concepts in flight
        training and break them down into a language much easier to understand.
        The website is a project that I’ve been working on when I can find time
        in between flying and my continued education towards my bachelors
        degree. I encourage you to return often and explore for more updates and
        topics discussed. I also urge you to subscribe and get email updates
        when new discussions are posted.{" "}
