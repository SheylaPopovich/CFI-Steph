            <p>This site is still very new and I'm going to slowly be adding new information as I have time. So continue to come back for new stuff and new blog posts, where I will tackle discussion on specific topics (let me know there are any topics youâ€™d like discussed). All information on this page is free of charge to anyone who chooses to use it. However, if you have the ability to help keep this site running, you will find a link below to donate. All donations go towards the fees associated with running this website. Thank you in advance, your contributions are appreciated; as without contributions, the site may eventually have to shut down.</p>
